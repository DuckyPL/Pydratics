<h2 align="center">About The Project</h2>

<p align="left">
	Pydratics, originally created by me (w3bhook#9982 on discord) is a quadratic equations solver + graph plotter that was originally intented to be ran in python 3.8.x but has support for 3.6.x - 3.10.x. To use powers/indices in the equation please do `number^power` e.g. `2^4` = `16` (this program will work out the equation as if y equaled to 0)

<h2 align="center">Setup :man_technologist:</h2>
<p align="left">
	1. Download the github repository <code>git clone https://github.com/DuckyPL/Pydratics.git</code><br>
	2. Enter the folder <code>cd Pydratics</code><br>
	3. Download the requirements <code>python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt</code><br>
	5. Run main.py <code>python3 main.py</code><br>
	6. In the terminal, you should now be prompted to enter the x coordinate values, after that you will be asked to fill in the quadratic expression<br>
	7. A new window should open up with your graph solved, and the y=0 quadratic will be solved in the terminal.<br>
